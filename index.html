            <h1>Home</h1>
            <p>
                In this experiment I want to see if I can build my own CSS styles using <a
                    href="https://open-props.style/">Open Props</a> as a <em>design system</em>, but without the
                <em>normalize</em> and <em>buttons</em> opinionated styles of Open Props. Different pages of
                this site will demonstrate different styling options.
            </p>
            <p>
                I decided to build the styles using a layered approach so that these layers can be used independently
                and
                stacked on top of each other as required.
            </p>

            <h2>Open-Props layer</h2>
            <p>
                The first layer is Open Props itself. It just declares useful properties that can be used in other
                layers for consistency. This layer does not make any visual changes to the HTML pages.
            </p>

            <h2>Normalize layer</h2>
            <p>
                The normalize layer is used as a base style to use for most of my internal projects. It should do a CSS
                reset and create basic styling for semantic HTML tags. This layer also offers light and dark themes
                dependent on the operating system's light/dark mode. It is also responsive based on the size of the
                device screen and resolution, to look good on anything from a large 4K display to a entry level mobile
                phone.
            </p>
            <p>
                This layer will also set up print styles so that printing a page would default to the normalized
                view with some slight modifications. It should not print the body header and footer tags and only print
                the main tag.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any layer built on top of the normalize layer should declare its styles inside a <kbd>@media
                    screen</kbd> CSS selector so that it does not break the printable styles configured by the normalize
                layer.
            </p>

            <h2>LCARS layer</h2>
            <p>
                The LCARS layer is inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCARS">Star trek LCARS</a>
                user interface as seen on the popular TV series. I say inspired by as I did not want to go all the way
                and try to clone that look and feel. When viewed in light mode users may not even realize the
                inspiration, but some may realize it when viewed in dark mode.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main purpose of this layer is to add some unique characted on top of the normalize layer as the
                normalize layer could be viewed as being a bit boring. It should show what is possible by the layered
                approach.
